## Abalone Analytics Blazer Reporting

This application utilizes a modified implementation of the [Blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer) gem to provide direct SQL access with data scoped to an organizational level. This requires setup in both the production and development environments.

### Production Environment

#### Initial Setup

This setup assumes Heroku hosting. Guidance for setup on other hosting platforms is welcome via PR. The maintainers will also update this document as the application evolves.

Note: Requires, at least, a Standard-0 Postgres instance in Heroku to allow for the creation of additional roles.

Note: For consistency, each org credential should be named with that organization's ID. Example: `org7`

1. Ensure that the initial set of organizations have been setup in the application.
2. In Heroku, add a credential named `blazer`.
3. Attach that credential to the application.
4. Set permissions to `Read-only`.
5. Create a credential named `org1` (assuming an organization with an ID of 1).
6. Attach that credential to the application.
7. Leave the permissions blank. They will be set by the Blazer rake task.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for each organization in the application.
9. In Heroku, add the environment variables for the blazer credential and all org credentials. The urls will be available under each credential in the Postgres add-on.  
    `BLAZER_DATABASE_URL: add credential uri here`  
    `ORG1_DATABASE_URL: add credential uri here`  
    `ORG2_DATABASE_URL: add credential uri here`  
10. Run the Blazer rake task: `heroku run SAVE=1 rake blazer:add_database_security`.
11. Log in as an organization user and confirm reporting is now functioning and scoped.

#### Adding a New organization

1. Add the organization to the application.
2. In Heroku, add a credential for that organization: `org#{ID}`.
3. Attach that credential to the application.
4. Leave the permissions blank. They will be set by the Blazer rake task.
5. Add the environment variable for the new credential using the uri available in the Postgres add-on.  
    `ORG#{ID}_DATABASE_URL: add credential uri here`   
6. Run the Blazer rake task: `heroku run SAVE=1 rake blazer:add_database_security`.
7. Log in as a user for that organization and confirm reporting is now functioning and scoped.

### Development Environment

#### Initial Setup

This process assumes initial setup, migration and seeding of a local postgres database as described in the [setup instructions](https://github.com/rubyforgood/abalone/blob/master/README.md).

1. Add the file `config/local_env.yml` (this is covered by the application's .gitignore file)
2. Add the blazer-related environment variables to the `config/local_env.yml` file. These will vary based on your local setup but the pattern provided below should work for most. Replace "password" with your chosen password. Note: A password must be present in the organization urls.
    ```text
    BLAZER_DATABASE_URL: postgres://blazer:password@localhost:5432/abalone_development
    ORG1_DATABASE_URL: postgres://org1:password@localhost:5432/abalone_development
    ORG2_DATABASE_URL: postgres://org2:password@localhost:5432/abalone_development
    ```
3. Restart your server
4. Run the Blazer rake task: `SAVE=1 bundle exec rake blazer:add_database_security`
5. Log in as an organization user and confirm reporting is now functioning and scoped.

#### Adding a New Organization 

1. Ensure that the new organization has been entered in your local database
2. Add a url for the new organization to the `config/local/env.yml` file :   
    `ORG#{ID}_DATABASE_URL: postgres://org#{ID}:password@localhost:5432/abalone_development`
3. Restart your server
4. Run the Blazer rake task: `SAVE=1 bundle exec rake blazer:add_database_security`
5. Log in as a user for the new organization and confirm reporting is now functioning and scoped.
